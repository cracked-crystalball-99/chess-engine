# Stockfish for GitHub Pages

This is a free, open-source web interface for Stockfish chess engine, designed to run entirely in your browser using WebAssembly (WASM).

## How it works
- The chessboard and UI are implemented in HTML/JavaScript.
- Stockfish runs in your browser as a WASM module (no server required).

## Setup
1. Download the latest Stockfish WASM binary from the official Stockfish repository:
   - [https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases)
   - Download the file named `stockfish.wasm` (or similar) and place it in this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or deploy this folder to GitHub Pages.

## License
- Stockfish is licensed under GPL v3. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/COPYING) for details.
- This web interface is MIT licensed.
